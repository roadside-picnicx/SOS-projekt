# SOS-projekt
## Description
This is repository for project from BPC-SOS. Goal of this project is to make CentOS Stream 9 as small as possible. It must be able to open website in browser and pdf document. It's a minimal install, for browser I chose Otter browser and Xpdf reader. Currently I managed to drop it to 797MB, which is pretty good all things considered. This is my first time actually digging deeper into linux than just basic commands. It's not the best, there is always room for improvement
## Contents of this repo
- **.txt file** with what was supposed to be a script, at the time of typing this, it doesn't work as intended. Take it with a grain of salt. Otherwise it's a step-by-step tutorial of what I was doing.
- **.pdf file** the pdf file that I must be able to open 
- bunch of .rpm files which I wget to CentOS (the mirror links died so I uploaded it here)
